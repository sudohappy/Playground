## **Folder Structure**
----------------

Root Directory:

- The root directory is open for collaborative work. Feel free to contribute, modify, or add files outside individual folders.

Personal Folders:	

- After joining the collaboration, create a personal folder with your initials. This is your designated space to upload and manage your files.
Please maintain your personal folder and refrain from mkaing changes to others' personal spaces without permission.

Setup:

1. Create a empty folder. (EX: Playground)
   - Command git init
   - Command git remote add origin https://github.com/sudohappy/Playground.git
   - Command git fetch origin main --> You should see the files on GitHub on your device

2. Make Personal Folders --> mkdir "your folder name using your first 2 initials"
   - **Example:** Name John Doe therefore creating a folder JD
   - Command git add "your folder name"
   - **Example:** git add "JD"
   - Command git commit -m 'Adding new directory to repo'

3. Create a README.md in your personal folder --> git add "your folder name"/README.md
   - **Example:** git add "JD/READ.md" 
   - Command git commit -m 'Adding new file to repo'
   - Command git push origin main
