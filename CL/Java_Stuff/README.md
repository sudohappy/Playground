# Quick Rundown
As I delve into learning Java, I've structured my journey by orgranizing the content in order
1. DataType.java
2. ControlFlowStatements.java
3. MethodDeclaration.java
4. More to come.

# Reminder
Do Not Use the Command Prompt to execute the file
1. Main.java
	- If used, you will have to use the command "Javac Main.java"
	- When used it will create a binary/hex file that will execute the file
		- "Main.class"
	- To avoid creating a boat load of 'useless files' we should opt-into a IDE. Currently using Visual Code Studio, installing Java Compiler for it and not having any problems so far
