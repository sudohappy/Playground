# Reminder
Do Not Use the Command Prompt to execute the file
1. Main.java
	- If used, you will have to use the command "Javac Main.java"
	- When used it will create a binary/hex file that will execute the file
		- "Main.class"
	- To avoid creating a boat load of 'useless files' we should apt-into a IDE. Currently using Visual Code Studio and not having any problems so far
